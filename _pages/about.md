Hey, I'm Nam, a Machine Learning enthusiast! Currently, I'm a computer science student at the [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) and student researcher at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web), where I work on AI for recognizing mouth actions in German Sign Language, being advised by Dr. [Eleftherios Avramidis](https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=de&hl=de&user=HhcsbYgAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate). My research interests include inclusive technologies, applications of machine learning in healthcare and assistive systems - which is why I'm currently working on automatic lip reading and sign language.

Previously, I've interned with [Cambridge CARES](https://www.cares.cam.ac.uk/), a research centre of the University of Cambridge in Singapore, and [Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation](https://www.mercedes-benz-techinnovation.com/en/). I was awarded several scholarships such as the [Studienstiftung](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/) , Germanys's most prestigious scholarship, which supports me financially throughout my academic journey.

I hope to utilize the technologies of tomorrow to empower the people of today. Let's get in touch!
