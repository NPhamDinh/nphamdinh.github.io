  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Despite the importance of mouth actions in Sign Languages, previous work on Automatic Sign Language Recognition (ASLR) has limited use of the mouth area.
    Disambiguation of homonyms is one of the functions of mouth actions, making them essential for tasks involving ambiguous hand signs. 
    To measure their importance for ASLR, we trained a classifier to recognize ambiguous hand signs. We compared three models which use the upper body/hands area,
    the mouth, and both combined as input. We found that the addition of the mouth area in the model resulted in the best accuracy, giving an improvement of 7.2% and 4.7%
    on the validation and test set, while allowing disambiguation of the hand signs for most of the cases. In cases where the disambiguation failed, it was observed that 
    the signers in the video samples occasionally didn't perform mouthings. In a few cases, the mouthing was enough to achieve full disambiguation of the signs. 
    We conclude that further investigation on the modelling of the mouth region can be beneficial of future ASLR systems.},

  abstract = {When reading lips, many people benefit from additional visual information from the lip movements of the speaker, which is, however, very error prone.
    Algorithms for lip reading with artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks significantly improve word recognition but are not available for 
    the German language. A total of 1806 videoclips with only one German-speaking person each were selected, split into word segments, and assigned to word classes
    using speech-recognition software. In 38,391 video segments with 32 speakers, 18 polysyllabic, visually distinguishable words were used to train and validate 
    a neural network. The 3D Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Units models and a combination of both models (GRUConv) were compared, as were different
    image sections and color spaces of the videos. The accuracy was determined in 5000 training epochs. Comparison of the color spaces did not reveal 
    any relevant different correct classification rates in the range from 69% to 72%. With a cut to the lips, a significantly higher accuracy of 70% was achieved than
    when cut to the entire speaker's face (34%). With the GRUConv model, the maximum accuracies were 87% with known speakers and 63% in the validation with 
    unknown speakers. The neural network for lip reading, which was first developed for the German language, shows a very high level of accuracy, 
    comparable to English-language algorithms. It works with unknown speakers as well and can be generalized with more word classes.
